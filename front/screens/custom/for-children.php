              <p>Children are the greatest asset to the society, nation and mankind at large. The success of a society depends upon the overall development of the child. Modern education system provides academic knowledge but lacks in imparting the spiritual education, which is the foundational building block of a wholesome life. The Vedic scriptures elevate us to the platform of high moral standards & character, clarity of thought, deeper spiritual insights and life guiding principles.</p>
              <p>To compensate for missing spiritual elements in the modern system, Hare Krishna Mandir conducts systematic spiritual training program for school going children under the banner ‘Bal Sanskriti’.</p>
