              <p>The Supreme Lord Sri Krishna is worshipped thus: "My Lord, You are the well-wisher of the Cows and the brahmanas, and You are the well-wisher of the entire human society and world." (Visnu Purana 1.19.65)</p>
              <p>Srila Prabhupada says, "Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the prime protector of brahminical culture and the Cow. Without knowing and respecting these pleasing personalities, one cannot realize the science of God, and without this knowledge, any welfare activities or humanitarian propaganda cannot be successful." </p>

                <p>In the Srimad Bhagavatam it is said: gavah panca pavitrani: the cows deliver five products and all of them are pure and uncontaminated. The five products received from the cow are milk, ghee, yogurt, cow dung and urine. These five products, called pancha-gavya, are required in all ritualistic ceremonies performed according to the Vedic directions.</p>
                <p>In Vedic tradition, cows are worshipped as mothers. Just as the child feeds on the milk of the mother, human society takes milk from the cow. Srila Prabhupada always emphasized that the human society should recognize the importance of the cow and the bull and thus give all protection to these important animals. </p>
                <p>Following the teachings of Srila Prabhupada, Hare Krishna Mandir is maintaining a Gaushala with over 60 healthy cows and claves of native Gir breed in the service of Their Lordships Sri Sri Radha Madhav. <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/6_Opy5qF2UM">https://youtu.be/6_Opy5qF2UM</a> </p>
